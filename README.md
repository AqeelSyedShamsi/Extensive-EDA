# Exploratory Data Analysis of Publicly Available Housing Price Data
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of publicly available housing price data. The analysis is conducted using Python and its data analysis libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis is publicly available and can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset includes information about various features of the homes such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

* data/ directory contains the raw data file train.csv.
* notebooks/ directory contains the Jupyter notebooks with the house_pricing_eda.ipynb.
* README.md is the current file that provides an overview of the project.
## EDA
The EDA is conducted in the notebooks/house_pricing_eda.ipynb notebook. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization. The aim is to explore the dataset, understand the relationships between variables, identify patterns, and uncover insights.

</br> The EDA is structured into the following sections:

* Loading and understanding the data.
* Data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Exploratory data analysis.
* Feature engineering.
* Summary and conclusions.
## Requirements
To run the Jupyter notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

**pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn**
## Conclusion
The EDA provides valuable insights into the housing price data. It helps us understand the features that affect the price of a house and how they relate to each other. The results of the analysis can be used to build a predictive model for house prices or to inform investment decisions.
